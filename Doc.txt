Social MIT - Connect & Share

Introduction
Social MIT is a modern social media platform designed to enable users to connect, share, and engage with others. This project is currently focused on the frontend implementation, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. The backend is yet to be developed and will be built using Python and MongoDB.

How It Works
The frontend of Social MIT includes the following features:
- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- Home Feed: Displays tweets from users, allowing interactions such as likes, retweets, and replies.
- Explore Page: Showcases trending topics and latest tweets.
- Profile Management: Users can view and edit their profiles, including their tweets, likes, and retweets.
- Bookmarks: Users can save tweets for later reference.
- Notifications: Displays user notifications for likes, retweets, follows, and replies.
- Messages: Allows users to view and search direct messages.
- Settings: Provides options to manage preferences like appearance, privacy, and notifications.

Tech Stack (Frontend)
The frontend is built using the following technologies:
- React: For building the user interface.
- React Router: For managing navigation and routing.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design.
- Lucide React: For modern and customizable icons.
- Vite: For fast development and build tooling.
- TypeScript: For type safety and better developer experience.
- Date-fns: For date formatting and manipulation.

Backend Requirements
The backend for Social MIT will be developed using:
- Python: As the primary programming language.
- MongoDB: For storing user data, tweets, and other related information.

The backend will handle user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints to support the frontend functionality.

Next Steps
1. Complete the backend development using Python and MongoDB.
2. Integrate the backend with the frontend to enable full functionality.
